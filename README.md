# sumterForth
An ugly and incomplete forth interpreter in scheme

Calling `(forth)` in the repl will call forth the interpreter.

Word definitions end with `end` instead of `;`.

You can define words but you can't call them yet.

Use .s instead of .S , dup instead of DUP and so on. The code is very incomplete so most things won't work. 

You can pause the forth interpreter by typing `pause`, or you can `exit` and destroy the stack and defined words.
